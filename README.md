## Brief development history 

- ccd2022 is my sixth FSE theme.
- I developed it in an afternoon using the (Site) Editor beta delivered in WordPress 5.9-RC2.
- The background colours and gradients are a bit ugly.
- But no worse or better than the original Artisteer theme.
- It currently looks different with Gutenberg 12.3.2
- This is due to changes to the template parts attributes supported by Gutenberg.
